# Weather_Forecast-
## Description

Weather app using weather API to display the current weather and 5 day forecast for cities. User inputs city name into the input bar, once user selects the 'search' button, then it will save the city into a button. This button will store the daily and 5 day forecast. It utilises HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and JQuery.

This project has improve my user of JQuery when helping to render buttons from user input, saving and getting from local storage. This was my first time using 3rd party APIs and increased my knowledge of how to isolate different things within the array that it produces. Try function will try to run the function and catch function will catch if there is any errors, e.g. when an incorrect city or no city is inputted into the input bar. It helped me understand when to call or pass in functions to ensure that it correctly works.

## Installation
